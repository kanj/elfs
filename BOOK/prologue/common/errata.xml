  <para>The software used to create a ELFS system is constantly being
  updated and enhanced. Security warnings and bug fixes may become
  available after the ELFS book has been released. Once a release of
  the ELFS Embedded book is made, this page will provide a link to the
  ELFS Embedded errata page.
  <!--To check whether the
  package versions or instructions in this release of ELFS need any
  modifications to accommodate security vulnerabilities or other bug fixes,
  please visit <ulink url="&errata;"/> before proceeding with your build.
  You should note any changes shown and apply them to the relevant section
  of the book as you progress with building the ELFS system.--></para>
