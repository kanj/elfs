  <title>Beyond the Book</title>

  <para>The repository allows for even more possibilities: automatically building the system described in a book, adding packages to a build, and adding your own book. </para>

<para>

The same makefile that generates the book can also be used to automatically build a system.

It's as easy as this:
    $ git clone git://github.com/kanj/elfs
    $ cd BOOK
    $ make armMusl-build
    
Over the next several hours a complete system will be built in the ../sysBuild/clfs_armMusl

<title>Add a Package </title>
<para>

   Starting from the main directory adding a package is as easy as:
   
    $ cd BELFS
    $ make ARCH=armMusl slang-add

See appendix for status of supported packages.
