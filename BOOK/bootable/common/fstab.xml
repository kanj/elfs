  <title>Creating the /etc/fstab File</title>

  <para os="a">The <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file is used by some
  programs to determine where file systems are to be mounted by default,
  in which order, and which must be checked (for integrity errors) prior
  to mounting. Create a new file systems table like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; ${CLFS}/etc/fstab &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal># Begin /etc/fstab

# file system  mount-point  type   options          dump  fsck
#                                                         order

proc           /proc        proc   defaults         0     0
sysfs          /sys         sysfs  defaults         0     0
devpts         /dev/pts     devpts gid=4,mode=620   0     0
shm            /dev/shm     tmpfs  defaults         0     0
# End /etc/fstab</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para os="b"> For details on the six
  fields in this file, see <command>man 5 fstab</command>.</para>

  <para os="c">The <filename class="directory">/dev/shm</filename> mount point
  for <systemitem class="filesystem">tmpfs</systemitem> is included to
  allow enabling POSIX-shared memory. The kernel must have the required
  support built into it for this to work (more about this is in the next
  section). Please note that very little software currently uses
  POSIX-shared memory.  Therefore, consider the <filename
  class="directory">/dev/shm</filename> mount point optional. For more
  information, see <filename>Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt</filename>
  in the kernel source tree.</para>
