  <title>Creating a Build Directory</title>

  <para>A dedicated place to build the CLFS system needs to be created. For the purposes of this book, it is
  assumed that the working directory is <filename
  class="directory">/mnt/clfs</filename>, but the directory choice is up
  to you.   </para>

  <para>Choose a working directory  and assign it to the <envar>CLFS</envar>
  environment variable by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>export CLFS=/mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Next, create the working directory by
  running:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv ${CLFS}
</userinput></screen>

<para>Make sure you have non-root ownership of the directory. If required use chown -R to set the desired ownership. </para>
  

  
  <para>Now that there is an established place to work, it is time to
  download the packages.</para>
