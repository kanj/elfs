      </h1>
      <p>
        This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded
        for building a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers
        correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, and
        this book is based on their use. We highly recommend not using newer
        versions because the build commands for one version may not work with
        a newer version. The newest package versions may also have problems
        that require work-arounds. These work-arounds will be developed and
        stabilized in the development version of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
        location has changed since this book was published, Google (<a class=
        "ulink" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>)
        provides a useful search engine for most packages. If this search is
        unsuccessful, try one of the alternative means of downloading
        discussed at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://cross-lfs.org/files/packages/embedded-0.0.1/">http://cross-lfs.org/files/packages/embedded-0.0.1/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere that
        is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working
        directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them.
        <code class="filename">${CLFS}/sources</code> can be used both as the
        place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working directory.
        By using this directory, the required elements will be located on the
        CLFS partition and will be available during all stages of the
        building process.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this directory, execute, as user <code class=
        "systemitem">root</code>, the following command before starting the
        download session:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">mkdir -v ${CLFS}/sources</kbd>
</pre>
      <p>
        Make this directory writable and sticky. When a directory is marked
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">sticky</span>&rdquo;, that means that even
        if multiple users have write permission on that directory, any file
        within that directory can only be deleted or modified by its owner.
        The following command will enable the write and sticky modes:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">chmod -v a+wt ${CLFS}/sources</kbd>
</pre>
