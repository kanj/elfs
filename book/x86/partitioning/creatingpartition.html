      </h1>
      <p>
        Like most other operating systems, CLFS is usually installed on a
        dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building a CLFS
        system is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough
        unpartitioned space, to create one. However, a CLFS system (in fact
        even multiple CLFS systems) may also be installed on a partition
        already occupied by another operating system and the different
        systems will co-exist peacefully. The document <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt">
        http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt</a>
        explains how to implement this, whereas this book discusses the
        method of using a fresh partition for the installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes (GB).
        This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the
        packages. However, if the CLFS system is intended to be the primary
        Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
        will require additional space (2-3 GB). The CLFS system itself will
        not take up this much room. A large portion of this requirement is to
        provide sufficient free temporary storage. Compiling packages can
        require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the package
        is installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
        available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
        disk partition as swap space. This is used by the kernel to store
        seldom-used data and leave more memory available for active
        processes. The swap partition for an CLFS system can be the same as
        the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary to
        create another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start a disk partitioning program such as <span class=
        "command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> or <span class=
        "command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> with a command line option
        naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be
        created&mdash;for example <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code> for
        the primary Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create a Linux
        native partition and a swap partition, if needed. Please refer to
        <code class="filename">cfdisk(8)</code> or <code class=
        "filename">fdisk(8)</code> if you do not yet know how to use the
        programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <code class=
        "filename">hda5</code>). This book will refer to this as the CLFS
        partition. Also remember the designation of the swap partition. These
        names will be needed later for the <code class=
        "filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.
