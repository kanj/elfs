        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        Now that we have our base system built, we may add some optional
        additional functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this section, we explain how to make use of the Beyond Linux From
        Scratch project to add additional functionality. This will be done by
        updating the shell environment and by adding (select) packages that
        are part of the LFS build. Support for additional packages will come
        thru added support for different build systems, and by supporting
        pre-requisites that are part of the LFS/CLFS system but not part of
        the ELFS minimal root system. The most common build system is the GNU
        Build System (GBS), the next being CMake. For missing pre-requisites
        we will need to build the libstdc++ library, and ncurses.
      </p>
      <p>
        A build system is a set of tools that facilitates turning source code
        into an executable. We have been using the GNU Build System for a
        number of packages alaready. In the next section we will adjust the
        standard environment so that the same configure and make commands in
        the BLFS bok have the desired effect when using ELFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a list of packages and information about its build system and
        added pre-requisites see: <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://kanj.github.io/elfs/book/index.html">http://kanj.github.io/elfs/book/index.html</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ideal case you would enter the commands as given in BLFS for
        configuration and compilation. For installation you would execute the
        commands as the standard user, but then repeat steps in section 12 to
        create a new image. Results given in the BLFS compatability is based
        on this approach.
